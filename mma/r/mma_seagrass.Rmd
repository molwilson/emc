library(tidyverse)

Import and clean data
```{r}
seagrass <- read_excel(here("mma", "mma_seagrass.xlsx"), sheet = "quadrants") %>%  
  clean_names()

# expanding dataset by species
seagrass_spp <- seagrass %>%
  expand(nesting(site, transect, quadrant), species) %>%
  left_join(seagrass %>%
              select(site, transect, quadrant, species, percent)) %>%
  mutate(percent = if_else(is.na(percent), 0, percent)) # can't get replace_na to work so using this instead
```

Percent cover by species
```{r}
cover_spp <- seagrass %>%
  group_by(site, transect, species) %>%
  summarize(cover_mean = mean(percent),
            cover_se = sd(percent)/sqrt())
```
